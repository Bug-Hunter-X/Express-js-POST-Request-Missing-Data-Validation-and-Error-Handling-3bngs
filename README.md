# Express.js POST Request Missing Data Validation and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for data validation in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a vulnerable endpoint that fails to handle situations where the request body is missing or contains invalid data.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling and data validation, illustrating best practices for secure and reliable Express.js development.  This improved version checks for missing or invalid data and responds appropriately with error messages.
